<h1>A Little About <i>Frogs</i></h1>


<h2 style="color:green;"><i>Frogs:</i></h2>

<p><b>Frogs</b> are amphibians and vertebrates of the order Anura. There is not much difference between frogs and toads, and they are not classified separately.</p>
<br>This is because the toad lifestyle, with its dry, rough, skin, is an adaptation to living in drier habitats. The toad form has evolved a number of times 
<br>independently, an example of convergent evolution.
<br><br></p><b>Frogs</b> can live on land and in <b style="color:aquamarine;">fresh water.</b> They cannot survive in salt water. Their development is by metamorphosis. They usually hatch as tadpoles 
<br>from eggs, which are laid by a female frog. The eggs are called frogspawn. Tadpoles have tails and gills. The next stage, the "froglet," develops lungs to 
<br>breathe air instead of gills, but still have tails. The fully grown frog has long legs and no tail.
